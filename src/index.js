import loadHomepage from './home.js'
//I wanted to use this module to load set up the DOMs of the page,
// unfortunately, I get "Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module" errors
// maybe I have to add the module somewhere, maybe I have to use require instead, I surrender, for noww
